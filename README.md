# Single-Player-Pong


This is the first project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science computing Initiative (CSSI).

For this project, using the limit knowledge I had aquired so far, I attempted to create a pong like game. In this project I wanted to see if I could create a collision system from scratch that would update as the various objects changed in size and location.

Controls:
Left bar:
w-up
s-down

Right bar:
up arrow- up
down arrow- down

If you would like to set up and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser, our you can find an online Demo of the project here: https://PONG.armandode.repl.co
